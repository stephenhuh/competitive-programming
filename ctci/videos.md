t9 calculator problem

how many digits presed before autocomplete appears?
does it start after 1 press or 3 presses?
are we given a list of words in the dictionary?
hash that goes to a given bucket based on the number pressed, so if abc is pressed then it goes to the 1 bucket. 9 buckets.
hash can be defined by dividing by 3. and that'd be the quotient of the bucket.
do i want linked lists or binary trees within the bucket?
linked lists would take shorter time to make because of the O(1) insertion time
bsts would take longer time but has a faster search overall at Ologn. makes sense to use a BST
what about a TRIE?
or N-ARY trees?

body language is important here
