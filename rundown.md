#Algorithms:
* bubble sort - iterate through and check, when no more swaps its done, stop the inner loop when elements are in order.
* selection sort - selects smallest element and pushes it into a new array (subarray), inplace
* insertion sort - inserts element in-order into a new array(subarray), inplace
* cocktail sort - bidirectional bubble sort
* quick sort
* merge sort
* heap sort
* binary search
* breadth-first
* depth-first
