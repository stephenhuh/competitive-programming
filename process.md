see process breakdown in moleskine
1. clear up any questions
2. pseudocode
	* write TEST CASES (TDD)
	* run through example (examplify)
	* pattern matching
	* simplify and generalize
	* base case and build
	* data structure brainstorm

1. clear up any questions
	* ask questions
	* fully understand the given problem
	* draw it out!! write it out

2. understand the assets given and their pros and cons
	* benefits from ds and whats given
	* example: a binary search tree has given that the left node is less than its parent.

3. come up with some test cases
	* are these test cases mutually exclusive?
	* what can i add to the assets given based on the test cases?
	* what else can i learn

4. design algorithm
	* examplify
	* pattern matching
	* simplify and generalize
	* base case and build
	* data structure shoot
	
5. write pseudocode

6. write your code

7. test code from test cases drawn before, and add more
talk while doing this

go into corner cases
