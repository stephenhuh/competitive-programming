//Check if characters of a given string can form a palindrome

/*
 *  Palindromes -- 
 *  racecar - length 7
 *  wow   - length 3
 *  aabbaa - length 6
 *  seeeees - length 7
 * 
 * Observation all character counts must be even except one character that is in the middle when length is odd
 * Dont forget the main point, a string reversed and equal is by definition a palindrome
 *
 * Just reverse honestly, you can use an array as the data structure to check for characters if there is more complicated processing going on
