#Linked Lists
* head is just a pointer to a node within the linked list not the actual node itself
* while (temp->next != NULL) temp = temp->next means to traverse to the end of the list and have temp point to that very last node

##BIG O
note that the operations are independent of traversing to perform the operation
access - O(n)
search - O(n)
insertion - O(1)
deletion - O(1)

##Array BIG O
frequently linked lists are compared to arrays which are a bit different because they are indexed
access - O(1)
search - O(n)
Insertion - O(n)
deletion - O(n)


time complexity? space complexity?
